# life-expectancy-and-gdp-project
This project is my attempt of Codecademy's Data Visualization Portfolio Project. It visualizes the life expectancy and GDP of six countries, America, China, Germany, Mexico, Chile, and Zimbabwe.
Three kinds of graphs are shown, Life Expectancy vs GDP, Life Expectancy vs Year, and GDP vs Year. This allows us to better understand the factors surrounding the development of the six countries.
